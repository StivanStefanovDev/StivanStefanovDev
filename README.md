👋 Hey, I'm Stivan Stefanov

I help companies build reliable, high-performance web applications that scale efficiently and drive measurable results.
My work focuses on improving system performance, automating delivery pipelines, and turning complex requirements into maintainable solutions that directly support business goals.

Currently contributing at Motor Trade Technologies, where I’ve:

Delivered new features used by 100+ garages across the UK

Improved database efficiency and boosted API reliability

Streamlined CI/CD workflows, enabling faster and safer releases

I bring a blend of front-end precision (Angular, React, TypeScript) and backend robustness (Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS) to every project — making development cycles shorter and deployments smoother.
